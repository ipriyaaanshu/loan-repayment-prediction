# loan-repayment-prediction
For this project I will be exploring publicly available data from [LendingClub.com](www.lendingclub.com). Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, as an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. I will try to create a model that will help predict this.  Lending club had a [very interesting year in 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lending_Club#2016), so let's check out some of their data and keep the context in mind. This data is from before they even went public.  I will use lending data from 2007-2010 and be trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full.
